Problems:
  - local imports don't seem to work?
  - is GOPATH the problem? I don't understand GOPATH...
  - how to do multiple main functions?

Workaround:
  - don't try to separate by package. everything in package 'main'
  - each executable defined by own subdirectory
  - shared code in common/ subdir. use symlinks to fool go into thinking that
  all these files are local for each executable
